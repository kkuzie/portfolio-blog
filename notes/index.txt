Design

It is all about imagination. I get inspiration from things I see, experience, or hear about in order to design logos, create interfaces and experiences that spark interest.
Gotta turn the world on its head to see different perspectives.
Development

Constantly aspiring to write cleaner code, be ever more efficient, and figure out how to bring designs and ideas to life.
Always thinking,
“There’s gotta be a way to do that.”
Figuring out the puzzle is half the fun.
Audio & Video

I can sing, I can dance, I make films.
Uh, nope.
But I love to give it a whirl and have so much fun editing parts together to make beautiful music and stories. Sometimes I add my voice then do a happy dance in my chair when it all comes together.

How do you make a digital product memorable? i have this belief that when a user lands on a digital product, though they expect certain familiarities such as a menu, they also want to see something memorable and engaging. 
long for an experience. 
the best websites i have been on are the ones that i can remember months later. 
Maybe it was just one feature such as 

Through engagement and familiarities. Which begs the question, how do you keep a user engaged? 
I have this belief that when someone finds a digital platform boring, their engagement will be limited and they will leave as soon as their task is done. 

What if the platform had something memorable that had the user wanting to explore more - even if subconsciously? The best platforms to me are the ones that make me say 'ooh, what does this button do?' or a scrolling effect that keeps me scrolling and exploring. Take a look at my portfolio - isn't the simple moving of your mouse mesmerizing?

Disney is one of the best at imagining the unimagined. I believe we all have ideas ready to burst out of us. I certainly have tons swimming in my brain. This passion to open a 'whole new world' to users is what I would bring to Disney along with my professsional expertise in UI/UX design and front-end development. Some highlights include:
