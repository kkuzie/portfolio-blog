The first door to unlock was the one into that got us into the collective mind of the site's audience.  Creating personas served as a key foundational piece to keep
                the design construct on point and inclusive.  

The objective was to create a design that would entice users to explore the courses of study and training services via not only clear and concise descriptions but a pleasing visual experience paired with an intuitive, user-friendly navigational path. 
                
               provides educational programs that empower students to earn degrees and skills certificates, as well as offering customized training for employees and/or clientele of businesses, nonprofit organizations, and public entities.
                
                The top 10 designs were chosen and individual teams formed to arrive at a winning, final product. It was
                a competition designed to get students' creative juices flowing -- and a real-world test of our
                developing skills. 
                As a born competitor with a great thirst for learning and artistic leanings, I viewed this assignment
                with enthusiasm!

                The design provides two ways to explore ETi's offerings from both employer and student perspectives. The

ETi loved it and is currently using it. (Another aspect of my artistic side, I enjoy creating logos and once even taught myself how to create my
                    own font design! See Po5) -->

 <p>The first four pages (Home, About, Students, Employers) were released in the incredibly short time span of just two months. </p>


           <h3>Sorting It Out</h3>
           <p>In order to make sense of the myriad of information that was currently on the site, we need to

            By sorting out the information on cards with possible tasks a user may be searching for, we were able to discern the what four main pages would be:
            Home: Brief description of ETi, course types, clients served
            About: Description, mission, why partner with ETi, award winner
            Students: Courses offered to students
            Employers: Describing how ETi can help employers train their employees
           </p>
 Each contributed to guiding the client to understand better what they didn't know they were looking for. Though all three were well-received, in the end the more traditional, conservative design was chosen.


            <p>Three designs were presented. Each offered distinct styles:</p>
            <p>
                ONE: Simple with a 50s retro undertone <br>
                TWO: Modern with artistic flair<br>
                THREE: Traditional and straight forward
            </p>

            <p>We investigated the pros and cons experienced by a variety of real-world website users and included astute
                consideration of ETi's expressed desires of professional and conservative. </p>


objectives:
order, symetry, usability - oh my
In designing and coding a minimum of four pages that avoided the frustration of muddling through the text-heavy prior state of the site, three main objectives were imperative to achieve for usability and efficiency:</p>

                <p>
                • order and symmetry<br>
                • logical flow<br>
                • a well-defined navigation pattern

CHALLENGE
Cluttered and outdated</h3>
            <p>Team was tasked with the redesign of ETi's existing website, whose issues included a lack of hierachy, disorganized content, and difficulty in locating and discerning the content and value of ETi's
                offerings. 
            
             </p>
            <p>Main goal was to provide a professional, uncluttered environment where potential clients would be enticed to explore the courses of study and training services via not only
                clear and concise descriptions but a pleasing visual experience paired with an intuitive, user-friendly
                navigational path.
            </p>
            <p>Voice and Tone:<br>
                • Professional, informative<br>
                • Conservative, easy (to navigate)<br>
                • More current in design


                Solution
                            <h3>Efficient Navigation</h3>
            <p>A minimal, easily navigated interface slimmed down to four main pages solved the initial problem of being overwhelmed by text. Direct links to offered courses simplified the site further. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    These efficiencies give the user a clear path of how to find what is needed whether as a student finding courses or as an employer seeking customized training programs. 

hierarchy
when you don’t have visual hierarchy, the following 2 scenarios usually ensue:

1) Confusion.
The viewer tries to take in the content but can’t. They bounce around all of the “parts” of the composition without ever getting the “whole.”

2) Defeat.
The viewer sees everything at the same level of importance. They pass up the “parts” because the “whole” doesn’t inform them where to start or how to get around causing them to miss your point entirely.

problems solved
                <!--When landing on the home page of a website, first impressions may keep the user there but the navigation will provide a comfort of knowing where they are going. . 
                    , highlight the best option for them whenever possible. Break complex tasks into smaller steps, that is using progressive disclosure when appropriate. -->

 outcomes

 
                <!--https://www.score.org/blog/12-reasons-why-small-businesses-need-website
                    Currently the business comes from direct contact with long-time business clients and military contracts. The website increases business credibility 
                    
                    In the digital age, not having a website for a business is grounds for suspicion; having a website is one of the criteria for determining trustworthiness.
                    Customers will seek you out online and and you will not be able to convert as many sales as you would if you have a more stable digital presence. 
                    
                    An inadequate or 'out of date' website may convey laziness or inattention to detail to today's consumer - traits that are extremely unattractive and lead the prospective client to 'swipe left'. -->

                 Getting a website is the first step toward putting your business in an environment where it can thrive. It allows you to promote your product, build credibility, distinguish yourself, and quite frankly - compete. If you’re not on the internet these days, you’re not being competitive and you will miss out on opportunities, even from loyal customers. If your customers can’t find you, they will find someone else.

                

                The website is the gateway, door, and welcome mat of a business. It should educate the consumer as well as elicit emotion. It is the very first impression that will be made on the consumer and can determine with certainty whether or not the consumer will continue engagement.

                A small business needs a website to drive business in today’s digital world. Without a website, you give up much, if not most, of your potential business because consumers will not be able to learn anything about you or your business’s offerings. If not for anything else, a website will show your audience that you really do exist.


                    <!-- The efficiency of the site provided  -->
              <!--   Since inital launch, cohesively designed individual pages describing each course in more detail was added. In order to allow for inquiries, a fillable email form that sent the inquiry to the specific contact in charge of each program was also added.-->

            <!-- just as in interior design, the visual design to include color palette,
                recognizes the audience. The team was attuned to the fact that an academia aesthetic differs greatly
                from a seaside aesthetic, for example. We decided on a color scheme with primarily a gray, white and
                soft blue with small punches of terra cotta to reflect a clean, contemporary feel. -->


                finale

                To mark the new main pages, each are distinguished by individual but complementary design and palette, featuring a relatable person representing different working sectors. 
                
                                <!-- <p>
                    STAY FLEXIBLE IN COLLABORATION<br>
                    Being more on the creative side of the spectrum, it was a challenge for me to design something conservative. This project gave me the opportunity to open my mind to others' ideas and not to say no right away. By doing this, 
                </p> -->
                <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
                <p>
                    DIVVYING THE WORK<br>
                    This was the first time I led a project from meeting with the client all the way through the coding and launch of the site. At the start of the project, whether it was screen design or coding a page, we would be working on the same sections simultaneously. As we progressed, I learned that assigning sections for each of us to work on then coming together to collaborate not only sped up the process but gave the team a part of the project they could call their own.
                </p>
                <h3>Epilogue</h3>
                <p>
                    Since the initial phase outlined above, ETi has reached out to me in a freelance capacity for some continued
                    maintenance and updates. I have added additional course pages, functionable email form, and created their new logo design that incorporates the existing "star" that is
                    part of the San Diego Community College district logo (with whom ETi is affiliated). The analogy being that ETi is an
                    "offshoot" of the college.
