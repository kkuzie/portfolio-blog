decided to create a basic portfolio for the job hunt i have been procrastinating on. oh, i have applied for things, but perhaps i have a bit of imposter syndrome, or maybe it is just that i am still trying to think through exactly what type of company i want to work for or maybe i just havent found that company yet. i know i want a creative company, i want to be able to learn new cool things, but key is that we create interesting websites not cookie cutter ones. i am inspired by sites seen on awwwards and the like. that is what makes me sit down and code everyday. I
so i found a portfolio tute on building and deploying a portfolio website with Kevin Powell one of my go-to guys in development instruction. 

Already learning little details that i didnt know - 
    gonna utilize BEM which is something i have been wanting to learn more deeply,
    found out the use of aria-label which helps with accessibility since there is no label or text stating what this button does.
    using border-box changes how padding is calculated to make it within a width instead of adding on to the total width.
    root is where you can set up custom properties
    always good to use 'em' on text since it is relative to font-size

gsap animations:
    walked away from the animation for the night. I couldn't figure out why the hover over the h1 wasnt producing the animation. I had set up the new var, duplicated the animation and changed the name to the new var. Seems logical that it would work, right? 

    Nope.

    Console.log showed that the mouseenter was working properly, yet the animation wasnt happening. Erg.  Finally, I commented out the animation for the individual animations - the right and the left sides. And lo and behold the hover over the h1 animated the left and right. But it was enough for the night. i still didnt know why it was doing this.

    the next morning, i sat down looked at the code for a mere second and it came to me. I didnt need to create a new var for both the animations. The vars for them were already created. what if I use the tlPeekInR and tlPeekInL with the method .play()?  and gosh diddly darn, it flippin worked. easy peasy. 

    Walking away, leaving it be clears the mind. And in mere seconds the solution was in front of me the following morning. I am still amazed how the simple act of stopping and returning "magically" makes the solution appear. 

CHallenge:
in order to scroll to a section, one uses href and ids. 
I needed to use the href and ids for an image to appear when hovering over a link (<a> tag).
This posed the problem of having 2 identical ids which of course is not possible since the DOM wont know which id to go to so it will use the first one it sees.

to get around this, one can use data-target which allows for its own id, therefore on hover the image will be able to appear and on click the page will scroll to the section.

after many hours trying to figure out the z-index issue for the nav items which are 'hidden' when menu flyout is closed (even tho they were not visible, when hovered cursor over them the cursor turned to pointer)

the answer turned out to be to simply change the x from only -1000 to -3000 in order to "slide" the item completely off the screen.

//////// menu items stagger into view
    tl.from('nav ul li', .8, {
        x: -3000,
        opacity: 0,
        stagger: .3
    })

////////bar comes into view
    tl.from('.nav__item--hover-element', 1, {
        x: -3000,
        opacity: 0
    }, '-=1' )

solution for the navAppear on scrollup:
******first made the navScrollup a function so could call it again when needed

let navAppearOnScrollup = function () {

var prevScrollpos = window.pageYOffset;
window.onscroll = function () {
    var currentScrollPos = window.pageYOffset;
    if (prevScrollpos > currentScrollPos) {
        document.querySelector("header").style.top = "0";
    } else {
        document.querySelector("header").style.top = "-180px";
    }
    prevScrollpos = currentScrollPos;
}
}
navAppearOnScrollup();

******then created an adaptation of the navScrollup that hid the nav bar.

let pauseNavAppearOnScrollup = function () {
var prevScrollpos2 = window.pageYOffset;
window.onscroll = function () {
    var currentScrollPos2 = window.pageYOffset;
    if (prevScrollpos2 < currentScrollPos2) {
        document.querySelector("header").style.top = "-180px";
    } else {
        document.querySelector("header").style.top = "-180px";
    }
    prevScrollpos2 = currentScrollPos2;
}
}

******then incorporated both to onclick of nav items adding a delay to the navAppearOnScrollup function in order for it to once again work when scrolling up. but the paused version stops it from appearing when nav 'scrolls' to a previous section located above the current position.

///////removes nav-open so flyout disappears - menu closed
navLinks.forEach((link) => {
    link.addEventListener('click', () => {
        document.body.classList.remove('nav-open');

        //disable scrollup nav appear
        pauseNavAppearOnScrollup();

        //re enable scrollup nav appear 
        window.setTimeout(function () {
            navAppearOnScrollup();
        }, 3000);

    })
});

little bother: video tag in html 

autoplay loop is supposed to autoplay video. worked in other pages not for a particular video. 
it did work with controls loop but had to press play. 

turns out, for whatever reason the fix for this was to add muted as well - autoplay loop muted. 
and lo and behold, it worked. go figure.
